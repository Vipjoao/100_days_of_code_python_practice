Day 16

In this day we learned the importance and usefulness of
importing python packages, as well as import 3rd party packages.

The challenge was to re-create the virtual coffee machine from Day 15
by using a pseudo package provided by the teacher.

(Pseudo Package: a bunch of files that simulate an imported package)
