Day 18

In this day we learned the difference between tuples and lists.

This day also had multiple challenges involving the turtle python package.
The purpose of each challenge can be found in the first line of each individual file.

There was an extra challenge to reproduce a painting from 'Damien Hirst' that is
literally a bunch of dots, by using the 'colorgram' package. But this challenge
was skipped because it was too easy and unnecessary.
