Day 3

In this day we learned how the conditional statements
in python works, such as: 'if', 'elif' and 'else'.
And we've learned how to use the modulo operator '%' to
get the surplus value from a division.

The challenge of today was a basic treasure island with
a few 'if' statements to determine the results of each
decision that the user made.
