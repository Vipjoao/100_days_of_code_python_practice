Day 2

In this day we learned how to use python's mathematical
operations and how to print them. We've also learned how
the python datatypes work and how to print each mathematical
operation with different values by using 'round', 'type' etc.

The challenge of today was a script to calculate based on the
inputs, how much each person would pay of a bill.
