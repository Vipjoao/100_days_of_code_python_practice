In this git repository I'll post every practical lessons from the 100 Days of Code Udemy course that I took.

The course is called: "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp", and it was made by Dr. Angela Yu.

It's worth to mention that there are some days that have the same project (such as days 20 and 21), and because
of that, these days will be on the same folders.
