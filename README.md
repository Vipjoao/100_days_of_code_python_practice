In this git repository I'll post every practical lession from the 100 Days of Code Udemy course that i took.

The course is called: "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp", and it was made by Dr. Angela Yu.

It's woth to mention that the days 1-15 are in the same folder, because all of them were made with
help from the course's teacher. And that's why also the days 16-20 are in a smaller folder.
As for the subsequent days, they are organized as 10 days by folder.
