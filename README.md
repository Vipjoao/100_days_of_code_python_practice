# 100_days_of_code_python_practice
I'll post every practical lession from the 100 Days of Code Udemy course that i took.


It's woth to mention that the days 1-15 are in the same folder, because all of them were made with
help from the course's teacher. And that's why also the days 16-20 are in a smaller folder.
As for the subsequent days, they are organized as 10 days by folder.
