Day 15

In this day we created a virtual coffee machine, where it only
accepted coins.
Then basically we would choose how many coins we'd want to put in the
machine, and choose between three options 'latte', 'capuccino' and 'espresso'.
Where each option would subtract a certain number of resources from the
machine.
There were also functions for:
Creating reports to see the resources inside the machine
A function where if you typed 'off' you'd turn the machine off and end the application
And a function that returned the change from the inputed money.
